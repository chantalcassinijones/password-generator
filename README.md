# password-generator
Fifth Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX
## Description

This was the fifth challenge for the University of Birmingham bootcamp in front-end web-developing and UX. In this challenge, I had to create a password generator, which met the following requirements: 

generate a password when the button is clicked

present a series of prompts for password criteria- length of password, at least 8 characters, but no more than 128, characters types lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. 

code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected. 

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written on the page. 

Guidelines for successful completition of this challenge also included having a github repo, a good readMe file. 

This challenge was really fun and consolified how to use functions and get them to work together. I also enjoyed figuring out how to connect the javascript to the html and css. 


## Usage

 All you need to do is open [this page](https://chantalcassinijones.github.io/password-generator/) in your browser. Click on the generate password red button and follow the prompts. After all prompts have been answered, a password will be generated, unless conditions are not met.
